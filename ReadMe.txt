Hi, the app does what it was asked for in the challenge.

There are two tabs contact and data. 

In contact tab we can see the contacts that are available and send message to those contacts.
In data we can see sent messages.

I was unabled to find any dedicated api for sms sending but was able to do it somehw, although it shows cors error but messages
are still being sent. So try the app out.
